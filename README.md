# GraphPathfindingAlgorithms

Here are the features of the provided code:

> Graph Representation: The code provides a representation of a graph using an adjacency list where each vertex is associated with a list of its neighbouring vertices along with their weights.
> Algorithms: Four different shortest path algorithms are implemented:
  1. A* Algorithm: An informed search algorithm that uses a heuristic to guide its search.
  2. Swarm Algorithm: A metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the behaviour of social insects such as ants.
  3. Dijkstra's Algorithm: A classic algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph.
  4. Breadth-First Search: A simple algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.

> Pheromone Update: In the Swarm Algorithm, pheromones are used to update paths based on the agents' movements.
> Input Handling: The code prompts the user to input the number of edges and the details of each edge (source, destination, and weight). It also prompts the user to input the source and destination nodes.
> Global Algorithm Selection: The code alternates between the four algorithms in each run, ensuring that all algorithms are utilized.
> Error Handling: The code includes error handling to manage cases where the input data format is incorrect or insufficient.
> Randomization: Randomization is used to select the algorithm to be executed in each run, ensuring that the selection is not biased towards any particular algorithm.
> Object-Oriented Design: The code is structured using classes for Pheromone, Graph, Swarm, and SwarmAgent, promoting modularity and code reusability.

Overall, the code provides a flexible framework for exploring and comparing different shortest-path algorithms on a given graph.
